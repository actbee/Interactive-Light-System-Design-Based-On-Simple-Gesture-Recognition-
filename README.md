# Interactive Light System Design Based On Simple Gesture Recognition 

## Introduction

This is a project I made based on Openframeworks, an amazing creative coding frameworks. 
Things are keep going so this project is still on the move.
I will update this document once I have finished most of the works. 

## GAP Warning

Since most of the professors in PD actually do not care about the design of hardwares and the code itself, 
there is a great possibility that I can not gradute on time even though I finish this project normally.
Think really hard about how to release a nice visual output. God helps me!
