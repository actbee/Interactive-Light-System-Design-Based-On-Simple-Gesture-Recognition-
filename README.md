## Introduction

This is a project I made based on Openframeworks, an amazing creative coding frameworks. 
The project is an interative light system with an arcade outlook. With Kinect V2 it can recognise simple gesture and give output images with
a style of pixel culture or a classic SNAKE game interactively.


## Meaning

Using a whole new way to interactive with the past things, please try to consider the relationship between the past and the future. If it is 
possible to bring the old things reborn by the new technologies? And feel the consistant humanism thoughts under the fast growing technologies.


## How to run

Please make sure you have installed the basic Kinect V2, OpenCV and Openframeworks environments on WIN before running this. The IDE I used in this project is VS2017. 
You can find all of the core codes under the 2/2/sec/file. In the KINECT file there are some codes I wrote to test the function of Kinect V2. You can find the design
report (in Chinese) in the PPT file.
