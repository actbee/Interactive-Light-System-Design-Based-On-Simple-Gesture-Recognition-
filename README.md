## Introduction

This is a project I made based on Openframeworks, an amazing creative coding frameworks. 
The project is an interative light system with an arcade outlook. With Kinect V2 it can recognise simple gesture and give output images with
a style of pixel culture or a classic SNAKE game interactively.


## Meaning

Using a whole new way to interactive with the past things, please try to consider the relationship between the past and the future. If it is 
possible to bring the old things reborn by the new technologies? And feel the consistant humanism thoughts under the fast growing technologies.
